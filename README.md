# zorki4-case

A 3D printed case for my lugless Zorki 4K. I don't like the leather cover, so I modelled this in FreeCAD. 

Might add a timer-arm cutout and some sort of stencil-style artwork in the back to save material!

I've also added a hot shoe adapter to make ergonomics slightly better for the lightmeter!
