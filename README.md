# zorki4-case

A 3D printed case for my lugless Zorki 4K. I don't like the leather cover, so I modelled this in FreeCAD. 

I should add some feet so it can stand straight at some point, and I should make a cutout for the timer arm. 

I'm also considering to do some stencil-style artwork in the back!
